## Framework Standards

### ISTQB Framework Application

Our testing approach implements ISTQB best practices including:

- **Test Process Activities**: Planning, monitoring, analysis, design, implementation, execution, completion
- **Test Design Techniques**: Black-box, white-box, and experience-based testing approaches
- **Test Types**: Functional, non-functional, structural, and change-related testing
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### ISO 25010 Quality Model

Quality validation follows ISO 25010 characteristics:

- **Functional Suitability**: Feature completeness, correctness, appropriateness
- **Performance Efficiency**: Time behavior, resource utilization, capacity
- **Compatibility**: Co-existence, interoperability
- **Usability**: User interface, accessibility, learnability, operability
- **Reliability**: Fault tolerance, recoverability, availability
- **Security**: Confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization
- **Maintainability**: Modularity, reusability, testability
- **Portability**: Adaptability, installability, replaceability

## Testing Levels and Coverage

### Unit Testing
- **Framework**: xUnit for .NET
- **Coverage Targets**: 80% line coverage, 90% branch coverage for critical paths
- **Components**: Controllers, Models, Helpers, Data Access Layer

### Integration Testing
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core TestHost, Entity Framework InMemory
- **Focus**: Component interactions, API contracts, database operations
- **Coverage**: Service integrations, middleware, dependency injection

### End-to-End Testing
- **Framework**: Playwright for browser automation
- **Coverage**: Complete user workflows, cross-browser compatibility
- **Scenarios**: Product browsing, shopping cart, checkout process

### Performance Testing
- **Framework**: NBomber for load testing
- **Metrics**: Response times, throughput, resource utilization
- **Targets**: Page loads <2s, API responses <500ms

### Security Testing
- **Framework**: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube
- **Coverage**: OWASP Top 10, input validation, authentication
- **Standards**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

### Accessibility Testing
- **Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Coverage**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, color contrast
- **Target**: 95% compliance score

## Quality Gates and Metrics

- **Availability**: 99.9% system uptime
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

## Implementation Guidelines

### Task Estimation
- **Unit Tests**: 0.5-1 story point per component
- **Integration Tests**: 1-2 story points per interface
- **E2E Tests**: 2-4 story points per user workflow
- **Performance Tests**: 3-5 story points per requirement
- **Security Tests**: 2-4 story points per requirement

### Labeling Standards
- **Test Types**: `unit-test`, `integration-test`, `e2e-test`, `performance-test`, `security-test`
- **Quality Focus**: `quality-gate`, `iso25010`, `istqb-technique`, `risk-based`
- **Priority**: `test-critical`, `test-high`, `test-medium`, `test-low`
- **Components**: `frontend-test`, `backend-test`, `api-test`, `database-test`

### Dependencies Management
- Sequential dependencies clearly documented
