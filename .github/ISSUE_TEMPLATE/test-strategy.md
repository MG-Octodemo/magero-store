# Test Strategy: {Feature Name}

## Test Strategy Overview

{Summary of testing approach based on ISTQB and ISO 25010}

## ISTQB Framework Application

**Test Design Techniques Used:**
- [ ] Equivalence Partitioning
- [ ] Boundary Value Analysis
- [ ] Decision Table Testing
- [ ] State Transition Testing
- [ ] Experience-Based Testing

**Test Types Coverage:**
- [ ] Functional Testing
- [ ] Non-Functional Testing
- [ ] Structural Testing
- [ ] Change-Related Testing (Regression)

## ISO 25010 Quality Characteristics

**Priority Assessment:**
- [ ] Functional Suitability: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
- [ ] Performance Efficiency: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
- [ ] Compatibility: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
- [ ] Usability: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
- [ ] Reliability: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
- [ ] Security: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
- [ ] Maintainability: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}
- [ ] Portability: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Entry criteria defined
- [ ] Exit criteria established
- [ ] Quality thresholds documented

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk Areas:**
- {List high-risk components or scenarios}

**Medium Risk Areas:**
- {List medium-risk components or scenarios}

**Low Risk Areas:**
- {List low-risk components or scenarios}

## Test Environment Requirements
- {Specify required test environments}
- {Database and data requirements}
- {Tool and framework requirements}

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage targets met (80% line, 90% branch)
- [ ] Quality gates passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved
- [ ] Security validation completed

## Dependencies
- {List any dependencies on other features, teams, or tools}

## Estimate
{Strategic planning effort: 2-3 story points}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test strategy document completed and approved
- [ ] Quality characteristics prioritized and documented
- [ ] Risk assessment completed with mitigation plans
- [ ] Quality gates defined with measurable criteria
- [ ] Test approach aligned with ISTQB and ISO 25010 standards
