# Playwright Tests: {Story/Component Name}

## Test Implementation Scope
{Specific user story or component being tested}

## ISTQB Test Case Design
**Test Design Technique**: {Selected ISTQB technique}
**Test Type**: {Functional/Non-Functional/Structural/Change-Related}

## User Workflows to Test
**Primary User Workflows:**
- [ ] {Main user path scenario}
- [ ] {Alternative user path scenario}
- [ ] {Error recovery scenario}

**Edge Cases:**
- [ ] {Edge case scenario 1}
- [ ] {Edge case scenario 2}

## Test Cases to Implement

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Happy path scenarios
- [ ] Error handling validation
- [ ] Boundary value testing
- [ ] Input validation testing
- [ ] Navigation flow testing

### Non-Functional Tests
- [ ] Performance testing (response time ≤ {threshold})
- [ ] Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Visual regression testing

## Playwright Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Page Object Model development
- [ ] Test fixture setup
- [ ] Test data management
- [ ] Test case implementation
- [ ] Visual regression tests
- [ ] CI/CD integration
- [ ] Test reporting configuration

## Browser Coverage
- [ ] Chrome (Desktop)
- [ ] Firefox (Desktop)
- [ ] Safari (Desktop)
- [ ] Chrome (Mobile)
- [ ] Safari (Mobile)

## Test Data Requirements
- {Specify required test data}
- {Data setup and cleanup procedures}
- {Mock data requirements}

## Performance Criteria
- [ ] Page load time ≤ 2 seconds
- [ ] User interaction response ≤ 500ms
- [ ] API response time ≤ 300ms
- [ ] Visual rendering stability

## Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Color contrast validation
- [ ] Focus management testing

## Dependencies
- [ ] {UI implementation completed}
- [ ] {API endpoints available}
- [ ] {Test environment setup}
- [ ] {Test data prepared}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All test cases pass consistently
- [ ] Code coverage targets met (80%)
- [ ] Performance thresholds validated
- [ ] Accessibility standards verified
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Test reports integrated in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Documentation updated with test procedures

## Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Flaky test identification and resolution
- [ ] Test environment stability validation
- [ ] Data consistency verification
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All planned test cases implemented and passing
- [ ] Test code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test documentation updated
- [ ] Performance and accessibility criteria met

## Estimate
{Test implementation effort: 2-5 story points}
